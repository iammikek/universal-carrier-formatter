# Sample outputs (committed)

Sample schema, OpenAPI, or other generated files that are **intentionally committed** for reference or demos go here.

- **Runtime output** (formatter, pipeline, mapper generator, etc.) should go in the repo root **`output/`** directory, which is gitignored. Nothing in `output/` is committed.
- **This directory** (`examples/outputs/`) is for sample outputs you want to keep in the repo (e.g. a canonical `schema.json` or `openapi.yaml` for docs/tests).
